The notify utility continiously prints changes in a specified directory in the following format:

M changed/path/1
M changed/path/2
-

Where M stands for "Modifed", and "-" is the indicator of end of changeset

Utility only returns specific directories that have changed, it does not print
the files/directories that have been modified: you need to determine them
yourself.

Linux-specific notes:

    1. You might need to adjust '/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches' to allow more directories to be watched
    2. If you have a lot of changes you might also want to increase queue size in /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events
    3. Watched queue can overflow and notify utility can run out of watched directories.
       When you get exit code 3, you need to restart the daemon and re-process all directories you are interested in.
